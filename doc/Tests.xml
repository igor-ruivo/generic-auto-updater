            <summary>
            This method is run on the server thread.
            Acts as a server, waiting for any request through the HttpListener.
            Expects a request on a file present in the local file's directory. Whenever it receives one, it reads the file and writes its content in the request's OutputStream.
            The request must contain a query parameter named behaviour, with the desired behaviour to be simulated by this server while answering the respective request.
